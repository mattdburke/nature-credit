# Code and Data for "Biodiversity and the Future Creditworthiness of Nations"

ðŸŒ¿ *Exploring the link between biodiversity loss and sovereign credit ratings.*

We directly incorporate biodiversity and nature-related risks into assessments of sovereign creditworthiness. We extend S&P Globalâ€™s sovereign ratings methodology to assess creditworthiness of 23 nations under a range of scenarios relating to changes in tropical timber production, wild pollination services, and marine fisheries.

## Running the code

To run this code, open `main.r` in the root directory and type in the path to the root directory in the `setwd()` command. Then, you can run the sequence of source code commands, or simply run `main.r` as a `source(main.r)`. You may also run any element of the code, but just be conscious that some of it is dependent on previous files and data being produced. 

- Typical installation time is minutes if the user already has R installed, without R this may take up to 30 minutes or so just to get set up.
- Note that this directory already has all the derived data, plots etc produced. You may wish to test the code by deleting all of the output and then re-running with just the data in the `data` folder populated.
- To download R, follow the instructions on [R project]([https://www.r-project.org/])
- There isn't necessarily any expected output to be had on the R terminal, only that the code completes within about 25 minutes on a normal PC. However, you can expect that the files in `derived_data`, `outputs` and `plots` be populated.
- For a brief description of each R file, refer to [code description](src/code_description.md), data is also described [here](data/data_description.md)

## Reproducing plots

To directly reproduce specific plots, you may use the command `figure1_B` to produce figure1_B, and so on. Alternatively, run the script `source(plots.r)`.

## System requirements

This code was run on the following system, print out from `sessionInfo()` command in R.

- This code, in various forms, runs fine on most versions of R and will produce the results without the need for many of the libraries. Some of these facilitate additional tests or producing the graphs etc. 
- There isn't a non-standard hardware requirement.

**Note** - Some of the code has redundancies, this will be cleaned up - however the main result is unaffected.
